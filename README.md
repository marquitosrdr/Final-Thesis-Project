# Deep Learning Models in Predicting Loan Default Probability
## Final Thesis Project in RMarkDown
### Marcos Rusi√±ol de Rueda, 2019

The main objective of the thesis is to apply a Deep Learning approach to the PD used to assess whether or not a credit transaction is granted. The goal is to set up a DL model that given an operation, it predicts whether it is granted [0], or not granted [1]. In particular, the thesis is intended to provide an explanation of the concepts of Credit Risk, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. As well as to carry out a simple practical implementation. Following this approach, the less error there is in an entity's PD predictions, the better the entity will be able to control and manage its risks and, consequently, have a better image of reality.
